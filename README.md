### Hi, I'm Tami

My full-time role as a Software Engineer is focused on Front End, while my part-time Developer roles are Front End & Full Stack.

Fun fact: I once created a Pokemon reaction game with Pokemon theme and cards purely due to the fact that the used API provided the nicest pictures I could find at that time (and not because I am into Pokemon at all) - sometimes you got to do what you got to do ðŸ˜„
